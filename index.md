Thank you for visiting my website!

My name is Aman Desai and I am a Post-Baccalaureate Intern at the [Center for Nonlinear Studies](https://cnls.lanl.gov/external/) at Los Alamos National Laboratory. In May of 2025, I graduated from UC Berkeley, where I majored in computer science. Broadly speaking, I am interested in understanding how global behavior emerges from local interactions in complex dynamical systems.
