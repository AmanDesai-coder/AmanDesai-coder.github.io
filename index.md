Thank you for visiting my website! My name is Aman Desai and I am a Post-Baccalaureate Intern at the Center for Nonlinear Studies (CNLS) at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Broadly speaking, I am interested in understanding how global behavior emerges from local interactions in complex dynamical systems.
